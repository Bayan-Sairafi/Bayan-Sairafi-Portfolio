## The audience
# The intended audience for my data story is young females, it is important to consider their interests, needs, and prior knowledge of this topic. Young females may be particularly interested in stories they can relate to it such as body image, self-esteem, and mental health, as they are often targeted by unrealistic beauty standards and face unique challenges related to identity and self-worth.

# I provided actionable steps for young females to take away from the data story. It can help them build resilience and confidence.

# Final thoughts
# Creating a data story requires careful planning and attention to detail. It involves identifying a topic, collecting and analyzing data, and presenting the data in a clear and compelling way. Throughout the process, it is important to keep the audience in mind and to tailor the content and format to their needs and interests.

# Here one of the biggest challenges I faceed is finding the right balance between data and storytelling. While the data is important for providing context and supporting the story, it is the narrative that truly engages and resonates with the audience. Therefore, it is crucial to use data to support the story and not let it overwhelm or confuse the audience.

# Overall, creating a data story can be a rewarding process that requires a combination of creativity, analytical skills, and communication skills. It is an opportunity to use data to tell a compelling story, raise awareness about important issues, and inspire action.
